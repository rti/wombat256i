Improved Wombat256 colorscheme for Vim by echofish (echofish.org).

Changes from original wombat256:
- Changed the static background color to terminal default, which makes it transparet (if your terminal is)
- Changed colors of line numbering
- Changed non text to nothing. Keeping space you havn't written on yet the same as the rest, and not hard black.
